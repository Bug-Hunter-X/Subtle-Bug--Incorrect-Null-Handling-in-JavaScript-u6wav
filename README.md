This repository contains examples of a subtle bug in JavaScript related to null value handling.  The bug demonstrates the difference between the loose equality operator (==) and the strict equality operator (===) when checking for null values. Using == can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with null or undefined values. The solution file provides the corrected code using the strict equality operator (===).
